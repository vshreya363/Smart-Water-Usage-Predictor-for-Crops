# Smart Water Usage Predictor for Crops 🌾💧

This project is a Flask web application that uses a trained Random Forest regression model to predict the water usage (in liters) required for different crops, based on real-time environmental inputs like temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and rainfall.

## 🔍 Features
- ML-powered water usage predictions
- Crop-specific estimations using one-hot encoding
- Interactive frontend with responsive design
- Model trained using Random Forest Regressor on custom dataset

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Flask (Backend)
- Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy (ML)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Frontend)
- joblib for model persistence
